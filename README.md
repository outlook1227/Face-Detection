# Face Detection

• Capture a face using Python with the OpenCV (cv2) library. This face has been captured in over 50 images for use in
facial recognition.
• Processing the dataset: filter to obtain a dataset with 50 images, and normalize using the LabelEncoder library
• Visualize the data and statistics of data labels with more than 50 images.
• Using Deep Learning (CNN) to train and predict each label in the data based on the name label, the resulting
accuracy is 99%.
• Compute for Accuracy, Precision, F1-score, Recall and result for confusion matrix for each label.
• Create an interface using the cv2 library and a trained model to recognize real faces through a WebCam.
